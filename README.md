# Lab 0 - Git Collaboration

In this lab, you will learn Git basics that you will use throughout the semester. The learning objectives are:
- Create a repository with multiple collaborators.
- Basics of Version Control Systems (VCS): commit & push.
- Learn how to work with branches.

## Step 0: Group formation (10-minutes)
If you have not formed a group yet, that's fine.

- Go to the link below and add your name to **any group with less than 4 members**.

- Go to Brightspace, and enroll in that group.

## Step 1: Repository Creation
- Each group should decide among themselves on the one student who will create the repository.
- The elected student should accept the following invitation, which will in turn create a repository for the rest of this lab.	- https://classroom.github.com/a/C1f4iKJP
- The owner of the repository will create a team and name it after the number of your group (for example **Group 1**).
- The rest of the group will then go to the same invitation, and join the group the repository owner has created.

## Step 2: Cloning & Pulling

- Given the access granted by the repository owner, each student can now **clone** the repository into their own machines.
## Step 3: Branching
- Each student should create a branch **with their name**.
- Make sure to **checkout** to your branch before making any changes.
  
## Step 4: Committing & Pushing

- **In your branch**, create a file with **with your name**. You can type whatever you want in that file.
- Add the file created to the repo using the `git add .` command.
- Commit the changes you made in the repo using the `git commit` command.
- Push the changes you made to your online repo on GitHub using the `git push` command.
